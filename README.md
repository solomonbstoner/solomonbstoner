### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Electrical and Electronics Engineering Junior in Singapore's Nanyang Technological University. My passion lies in software defined radio and wireless security. In my free time I participate in competition with friends, learn new concepts, and contribute to open source projects. I may also write an article or two on things I find interesting, which you can read on https://medium.com/@solomontan_68263.
